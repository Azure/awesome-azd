## 1. Name of resource
_A brief name to provide context_.

## 2. Resource author

## 3. What section should this resource be included in?
_Is the resource an article? A video? Something else?_.

## Next Steps

Once submitted, this issue will be tagged with the `awesome-readme` tag and it will be reviewed. We plan to do reviews on a rolling basis at regular intervals. The process will involve checking that template information is complete, and the template is valid. 
 * If we have questions or enhancements, we will add comments in issue thread (**issue stays open**)
 * If the contribution is approved, we'll update the gallery directly (**issue will then be closed**)
