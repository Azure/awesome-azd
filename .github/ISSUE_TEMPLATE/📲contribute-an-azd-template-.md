## Next Steps
Once submitted, the issue will be reviewed - we plan to do reviews on a rolling basis at regular intervals. The process will involve verifying that template information is complete, and the template is valid. 
 * If we have questions or enhancements, we will add comments in issue thread (**issue stays open**)
 * If the contribution is approved, we'll update the gallery directly (**issue will then be closed**)
