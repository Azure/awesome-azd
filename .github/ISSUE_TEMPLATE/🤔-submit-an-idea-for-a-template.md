## Template Idea

## 1. Suggested template name
_A brief name to provide context_.

## 2. Description of the application scenario/architecture
_What is this the purpose of this template? Are there specific pieces of technology or a specific stack you're interested in?_.

## 3. Architecture Diagram (`optional`)
_An image of the architecture, if possible_

## 4. Additional Tags (`optional`)
_Don't see a relevant standard tag for your template? Request these tags be added, and then used for your template. These could be new languages, services, or application domains_.

## Next Steps

Once submitted, this issue will be tagged with the `requested-contribution` tag so that anyone can pick it up and create the template.
