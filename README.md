| The Azure Developer CLI (`azd`) is an open-source tool that accelerates the time it takes for you to get started on Azure - with a set of developer-friendly commands that map to key stages in your workflow (code, build, deploy, monitor). The Azure Developer CLI uses extensible application templates that include everything you need to get up and running on Azure. The templates include application code and reusable infrastructure as code assets written in Bicep or Terraform and are infused with cloud best practices.  More than that, they cover end-to-end scenarios that go far beyond "Hello World!".|
