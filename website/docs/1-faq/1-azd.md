title: What is "azd"?
---

It's the command for the **Azure Developer CLI** (`azd`) - an [open-source command-line tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview?tabs=nodejs) that _accelerates_ the developer experience building real-world applications, using complex architectures, on Azure.

With `azd`, developers get a [rich set of commands](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/reference) that map to key stages of the developer workflow (code, build, deploy, monitor) in a manner that works _consistently_ across, azd templates, DevOps workflows and IDE.
