title: What is "azd"?
---

The Azure Developer CLI (or `azd`) is [open-source tool](https://aka.ms/azd) that provides higher-level, application developer-friendly commands that map to key stages in your developer workflow so that you can focus on writing application code instead of focusing on atomic operations on Azure resources.

Instead of focusing on atomic operations on Azure resources, azd allows you to use high-level, application developer-friendly commands that map to a familiar git-centric workflow. So we have commands like “provision” and “deploy” instead of commands that interact with specific resources and require you to pass in a bunch of flags and arguments.
