title: What is "azd-template"?
---


[Azure Developer CLI templates](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview?tabs=nodejs#azure-developer-cli-templates) (`azd-templates`) are _sample repositories_ created - using Azure Developer CLI defined conventions - to include the application code, tools and infrastructure code required to streamline your CI/CD pipelines. This now provides a repeatable foundation on which other teams can build, to customize, or extend, the default solution.
