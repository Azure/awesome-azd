title: How do I discover one?
---

There are a couple of ways to discover existing `azd-template` tagged repositories.

### 1. Using GitHub Topics
Today, you can look at the [`azd-templates` topic on GitHub](https://github.com/azure/awesome-azd) to see tagged template repositories. However, this approach does not easily let you _search_ for templates based on the services configured, or give you a visual sense of the _architecture_ enabled .

### 2. Using This Gallery
This is the challenge we are hoping to solve with the [gallery](/) site shown in this project. Each template is associated with the following:
 - architecture diagram
 - template repository
 - publication date
 - contributor identity
 - description
 - service tags (for architecture components)
 - language tags (for application code)

The Gallery provides both a **search** capability (to discover template by name) and a **filter** capability (to discover templates that match a specific and/or combination of criteria).
