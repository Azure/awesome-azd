title: How do I contribute templates?
---

:::info TWO WAYS TO CONTRIBUTE

You can contribute azd-templates in two contexts:
 * **For an existing idea** - matches a `helpwanted` tag
 * **For your own ideas** - provide the architecture diagram and tags.

We manage contributions using custom issue templates 
 * Pre-defined issues for existing requests
 * Custom issue template for defining new projects
:::

The contribution process:
 - Use custom issue and submit your template details **for new templates**
 - Reply to custom issue and submit requesed details **for existing requests**
 - Share the custom issue with others to get upvotes
 - Use the issues thread to provide requested updates

An internal team will review submissions
 - Validate that templates function as desired
 - Accept contribution - issue is closed.
 - Suggest modifications - issue stays open.
