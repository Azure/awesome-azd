title: How are templates rated?
---

This gallery will contain both Microsoft-authored azd-templates, and Community-contributed versions. Creating **and maintaining** templates is not a simple exercise. 

In the long term, we may add other tag options to help rate templates on other criteria (e.g., recently updated, most stars, most forks etc.)
