title: How do I request templates?
---


What if you have an architecture defined, but can't find an existing azd template to jumpstart your development? You can try to create and contribute that template as one option.

We are also considering a special `**help wanted**` tag that allows someone to contribute a template to the gallery with an architecture diagram but no associated repository. These would now be associated with _issues_ that would allow other community members to:
 - up vote the issue (as a priority)
 - create and contribute a template for it
