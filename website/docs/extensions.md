# azd Extensions

Azure Developer CLI (azd) extensions expand the capabilities of `azd` with custom commands, lifecycle events, MCP servers, and more.

## What are azd Extensions?

Extensions are plugins for the Azure Developer CLI that add new functionality. They can:

- **Custom Commands** — Add new `azd` commands (e.g., `azd app run`, `azd copilot build`)
- **Lifecycle Events** — Hook into azd lifecycle events (pre/post deploy, provision, etc.)
- **MCP Server** — Provide Model Context Protocol servers for AI integration
- **Service Target Providers** — Define custom deployment targets
- **Framework Service Providers** — Add framework-specific service integration

## Installing Extensions

Install any extension with a single command:

```bash
azd extension install <extension-id>
```

For example:

```bash
azd extension install jongio.azd.app
azd extension install jongio.azd.copilot
```

## Managing Extensions

```bash
# List available extensions
azd extension list

# List installed extensions
azd extension list --installed

# Show extension details
azd extension show <extension-id>

# Upgrade an extension
azd extension upgrade <extension-id>

# Uninstall an extension
azd extension uninstall <extension-id>
```

## Browse Extensions

Visit the [Extensions Gallery](/?type=extensions) to discover and browse available azd extensions.

## Submit Your Extension

Want to share your azd extension with the community? It's easy:

1. **Create a `registry.json`** in your extension repository (generated by `azd x publish`)
2. **[Submit an issue](https://github.com/Azure/awesome-azd/issues/new?template=extension-submission.yml)** with your registry URL
3. A workflow will automatically validate your extension and create a PR

That's it! Your extension will appear in the gallery once the PR is reviewed and merged.
