## We ♥️ Contributions!
`awesome-azd` is a community-friendly resource to help developer discover, create, and share, _azd-template_ resources for streamlining your application development and CI/CD pipelines. It is an _open-source_ effort open for contributions in many ways. 

## Our Custom Issues
The [custom issues](https://github.com/Azure/awesome-azd/issues/new/choose) page shows the different ways in which _anyone_ can contribute to make this project successful for _everyone_. 

### Submit a Template Idea
There are copious ways to combine languages with Azure services and tools to create applications, so if you cannot find a template combining the tools that work for you-- you can submit a request for that template. 

Keep in mind, a template can be used far beyond it's original purpose. For example, a [ToDo Application in C# with Azure SQL and App Service](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/todo-csharp-sql) can be modified and used to create a grocery list application. 

### Contribute a Template
Our template gallery will be at its best when our community is involved in creating new templates. 

### Submit a Resource
Did you write or find an article that helped you get started with azd? Or maybe you created or found a video that showed you how to create an azd template? Whatever the resource might be, we would love for you to share it with our community! So, use this issue to submit content you think should be included in `awesome-azd/README.md`
