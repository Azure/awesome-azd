## We ♥️ Contributions!
`awesome-azd` is a community-friendly resource to help developer discover, create, and share, open-source `azd` templates and supporting resources for streamlining your application development and CI/CD pipelines.

## Our Custom Issues
The [custom issues](https://github.com/Azure/awesome-azd/issues/new/choose) page shows the different ways in which _anyone_ can contribute to make this project successful for _everyone_. 

### [Submit a Template Idea](https://github.com/Azure/awesome-azd/compare)
There are many ways to combine languages with Azure services and tools to create applications, so if you cannot find a template with architecture that works for you-- you can submit a request for that template.

Keep in mind, templates are made to be flexible and extensible. You can use a template's architecture and swap out the source code. For example, if you want to create a grocery list making application using Azure SQL and Azure App service, you can use the [React Web App with C# API and SQL Database on Azure](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/todo-csharp-sql) template and swap out the source code. 

### [Contribute a Template](https://github.com/Azure/awesome-azd/compare)
Our template gallery will be at its best when our community is involved in creating and contributing new templates. 

We welcome contributions of [requested templates](https://github.com/Azure/awesome-azd/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Arequested-contribution) as well as any others, subject to review. 

If you would like to contribute a template but are not sure where to start, [making an existing project azd compatible](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/make-azd-compatible) is a great first step. Doing so consists of three main steps:
1.  Set up a new environment (with `azd init`)
2.  Add Bicep files
3.  Update azure.yaml 

### [Submit a Resource](https://github.com/Azure/awesome-azd/compare)
Did you write or find an article that helped you get started with `azd`? Or maybe you created or found a video that showed you how to create an azd template? Whatever the resource might be, we would love for you to share it with our community! So, use this issue to submit content you think should be included in `awesome-azd/README.md`
