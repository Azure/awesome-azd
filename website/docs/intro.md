## Submit a PR

### [Contribute a Template](https://github.com/Azure/awesome-azd/compare)
Our template gallery will be at its best when our community is involved in creating and contributing new templates. 

We welcome contributions of [requested templates](https://github.com/Azure/awesome-azd/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Arequested-contribution) as well as any others, subject to review. 

If you would like to contribute a template but are not sure where to start, [making an existing project azd compatible](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/make-azd-compatible) is a great first step. Doing so consists of three main steps:
1.  Set up a new environment (with `azd init`)
2.  Add Bicep files
3.  Update azure.yaml 

### [Submit a Resource](https://github.com/Azure/awesome-azd/compare)
Did you write or find an article that helped you get started with `azd`? Or maybe you created or found a video that showed you how to create an azd template? Whatever the resource might be, we would love for you to share it with our community! Submit content you think should be included in `awesome-azd/README.md`
